# LD49 Roboturai

This is my submission for the Ludum Dare Game Compo. I completed this without a game engine, and apart from starting out with a very bare bones template from learnopenGl where I 
learned to use C++ with openGL I wrote all the code during the competition. I also drew all the art, and made the music all within the 48 hour competition that start on Oct 1st.

Larger c++ projects are still fresh for me, and I am bad at building them currently, so the bundled files for download are way bigger than they should be but they
should include everything needed to run the game at least. Also I'm sure there are ways to build for other operating systems but for now my only knowledge is building for Windows.
